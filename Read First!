# Moving-Objects-Game
Another game that looks simple but very complex! 

Greetings all! 

This game is called Moving Objects! Now, the set up of the game
is not much visually. However, this game is very much difficult.
Let me explain the criteria. 

1) Miss the collision with the other blue block or its game over.
2) Move the player too fast or its game over.
3) You cannot collide on the side of the other blue block.
4) It must be a head on collision. 
5) Colliding with the Red block is an obvious Game Over.

Packages needed: 

    pip install pygame
    pip install sys
    pip install random

There is a slight discrepancy in the code where the game
ends unexpectantly. I commented where the possibility 
might be. This is challenge to my fellow Python developers out 
there! Fix the discrepancy! 

Happy Coding!
